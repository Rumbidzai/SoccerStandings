Thank you for your interest in Substantial.
===========================================

This is a small problem that we would like you to solve so that we can get an idea of your coding ability.
Your submission will be run in a clean environment to see if it produces the expected output. 
Please be sure to provide instructions for installing any dependancies.

What we look for
----------------
We will be looking at the quality and professionalism of your work. In particular we look for clean, well-designed, maintainable code. Although this is a rather small task, it should be approached as you would an actual task for a customer.

When you are finished
----------------------
Please push your solution to the master branch in the provided github repository.
There is no need to fork this repository to your own github account.

The Problem
===========
We want you to create a command-line application that will calculate the
ranking table for a soccer league.

Input/output
------------
The input and output will be text. Your solution should parse the provided
sample-input.txt file via stdin (pipe or redirect) or by parsing a file passed
by name on the command line. Your solution should output the correct result via
stdout to the console.

The input contains results of games, one per line. See sample-input.txt for
details. The output should be ordered from most to least points, following the
format specified in expected-output.txt.

You can expect that the input will be well-formed. There is no need to add
special handling for malformed input files.

The rules
---------
In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A
loss is worth 0 points. If two or more teams have the same number of points,
they should have the same rank and be printed in alphabetical order (as in the
tie for 3rd place in the sample data).

Guidelines
-----------
This should be implemented in a language with which you are familiar. We would
prefer that you use ruby, coffeescript, javascript, python, objective-c or java
(in that order), if you are comfortable doing so. If none of these are
comfortable, please choose a language that is both comfortable for you and
suited to the task.

If you use other libraries installed by a common package manager
(rubygems/bundler, npm, pip, gradle), it is not necessary to commit the
installed packages.

We write automated tests and we would like you to do so as well.

We appreciate well factored, object-oriented or functional designs.

If there are any complicated setup steps necessary to run your solution, please
document them.

Platform support
----------------
This will be run in a unix-ish environment (OS X). If you choose to use a
compiled language, please keep this in mind. (Dependency on Xcode is acceptable
for objective-c solutions) Please use platform-agnostic constructs where
possible (line-endings and file-path-separators are two problematic areas).

Questions?
----------
Please email jobs+coding-test@substantial.com if you have any questions.

Rob's Requirements
==================
This application requires Java 8 to run.
